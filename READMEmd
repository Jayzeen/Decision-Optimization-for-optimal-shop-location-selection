# Coffee Shop Location Optimization Using Decision Optimization

## Overview
This project aims to optimize the selection of optimal locations for setting up coffee shops based on their proximity to public libraries in a specific area.
The goal is to identify the best locations for coffee shops to maximize accessibility for potential customers while considering the distance to nearby libraries.

## Problem Statement
Given a list of public library locations and a predefined number of coffee shops to be set up, the objective is to select the optimal locations for the coffee shops.
The optimization model considers the distance between each potential coffee shop location and the nearest public library,
aiming to minimize the overall distance while ensuring that each coffee shop is adequately accessible to library-goers.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Decision Optimization**: The optimization model will be implemented using Decision Optimization techniques and tools.
- **Python**: Python will be used for data preprocessing, optimization modeling, and result analysis.
- **IBM CPLEX Optimization Studio**: CPLEX will be utilized as the optimization solver to find the optimal solution.
- **Geospatial Libraries**: geopy library is used for handling geographic data and calculating distances between locations.
